# SmartCampus : A Java Web App for Student Data Management with Spring and Hibernate
â€¢	I developed a Spring project aimed at managing student information within an educational institution. This project utilizes Spring Boot for 
  backend development, Thymeleaf for front-end rendering, and Hibernate for database interaction. It features functionalities such as adding new      students, updating their details, searching for specific students, and deleting student records. The project also includes a responsive user 
  interface with navigation options for seamless access to different functionalities. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in Java- 
  based web application development, MVC architecture, and database integration using Spring frameworks
